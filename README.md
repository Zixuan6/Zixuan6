## 👋 Introduction

- 🍃Hi guys, I'm **Zixuan Jia**, I am currently an Master student at [CompMusic Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/comp-music-lab/home) at University of Auckland.
- 📖Prior to coming to New Zealand🐑，I completed my BA in Chinese Language and Literature at [Minzu University of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minzu_University_of_China), MSc in Phonetics at [University of Edinburgh](https://ppls.ed.ac.uk/). Later, I worked as a research assistant at [Chinese Academy of Social Science](http://ling.cass.cn/EN/about/202310/t20231030_5693590.html) and [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/) for nearly two years. I was grateful to have been supervised by [Prof. Bei Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bei-Wang-5), [Prof. Alice Turk](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/alice-turk), [Prof. Yingyi Luo](http://paslab.phonetics.org.cn/?p=3399), [Prof. Shuwen Chen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=KihPE_wAAAAJ&hl=en), and to have closely collaborated with Ms. Jing Wang. 
- ❤️My research interest focuses on investigating the relationship between speech and music from evolutionary, acoustic, and neurological perspective. I am particularly enthusiastic about using acoustic analyses and computational tools to investigate these questions, and my curiosity about the human brain🧠 drives me to explore the underlying neural mechanisms of speech and music processing.
- ✍️I'm currently engaged in [Many Voice 2](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pv3m9_v3) and [Many Voice 3](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/c2dba_v2) projects, especially responsible for acoustic and statistical analyses in Many Voices 3.
